== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= When is "Simple CPT" needed?  =

Whenever you need to extend the functionality of your Wordpress site with your own type of content then you can create custom post types. Creating custom post types for books, movies, reviews, products and so on, can transform your website from a blogging platform to a custom software solution e.g. a bookstore, a movie database, a product listing site etc.

= What can I create with "Simple CPT"?  =

With the "Simple CPT" plugin you can easily create custom post types (Books, Cars, Movies, Songs etc.) and associated custom taxonomies (Brand, Color, Type, Genre etc.)

= When are custom Taxonomies needed?  =

Your regular blog posts use Categories and Tags to create an organization structure. Those build-in taxonomies can also be linked to any custom post type you create with Simple CPT.  However, the same organization doesn’t necessarily make sense for all custom post types. For a "book" custom post type, ideally you’d like to have the option to specify the book’s author, the genre, publisher and other book-specific data. This is when you create custom taxonomies and you associate them with your custom post type(s).

= Does "Simple CPT" require manual coding or file editing? =

Absolutely not. No technical knowledge is needed besides entering some text labels and selecting options from dropdowns. With a few clicks your CPT will be ready in a minute. Check out the screenshots above.

= Is "Simple CPT" compatible with my theme/plugins? =

Of course! "Simple CPT" is compatible with any theme and plugin that follows WordPress coding standards.
